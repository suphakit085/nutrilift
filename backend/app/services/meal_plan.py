"""Build one day's menu that hits the user's macro targets.

Same principle as ``nutrition.py``: the numbers come from Python, not from the
model. The LLM is told to call ``suggest_day_menu`` and report what comes back,
because a menu is a *sum* - a model that invents portions produces a plan whose
totals do not add up to the targets it just quoted, and nothing in the answer
would show that. Here the totals are computed from ``foods`` rows (the same
table ``lookup_food`` reads, every row carrying its ``source``), the deviation
from target is reported alongside them, and a plan that cannot reach the target
says so instead of being presented as if it had.

Pipeline, all deterministic - the same profile and ``variant`` always give the
same menu:

1. filter the food table by the profile's restrictions (conservative: a rule
   that might apply excludes the food) and drop rows whose macros are still
   estimates (``source`` starting with ``TOVERIFY``), since every number here
   is summed into a total compared against a target;
2. rank each role's candidates by how cleanly they serve that role, then rotate
   by ``variant`` so "ขออีกแบบ" gives a different menu without any randomness;
3. fill the requested three/four-meal template, refusing to reuse a food and preferring an unused
   food *category* per role, so the day is not four servings of the same fish;
4. solve bounded portions, prioritising daily feasibility before meal balance
   and preferred portions; independently validate the final reported numbers.

Food composition references stay unchanged. Planning uses a gram grid per food
kind, or whole units for countable foods, rather than treating a per-100-g
nutrient reference as a customary serving.
